# Utilities

> Unstorage exposes several utilities. You can individually import them and add only the needed bytes to your bundle.

## Namespace

Create a namespaced instance of the main storage. All operations are virtually prefixed, which is useful for creating shorcuts and limiting access.

`prefixStorage(storage, prefix)`{lang=ts}

```ts
import { createStorage, prefixStorage } from "unstorage";

const storage = createStorage();
const assetsStorage = prefixStorage(storage, "assets");

// Same as storage.setItem('assets:x', 'hello!')
await assetsStorage.setItem("x", "hello!");
```

## Snapshots

- `snapshot(storage, base?)`{lang=ts}

Takes a snapshot from all keys in the specified base and stores them in a plain JavaScript object (string: string). Base is removed from keys.

```js
import { snapshot } from "unstorage";

const data = await snapshot(storage, "/etc");
```

- `restoreSnapshot(storage, data, base?)`{lang=ts}

Restore a snapshot created by `snapshot()`.

```js
await restoreSnapshot(storage, { "foo:bar": "baz" }, "/etc2");
```
