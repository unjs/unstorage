# Custom Driver

> It is possible to extend `unstorage` by creating a custom driver.

Explore [src/drivers](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage/tree/main/src/drivers) to inspire how to implement them. Methods can

```js
import { createStorage, defineDriver } from "unstorage";

const myStorageDriver = defineDriver((options) => {
  return {
    name: "my-custom-driver",
    options,
    async hasItem(key, _opts) {},
    async getItem(key, _opts) {},
    async setItem(key, value, _opts) {},
    async removeItem(key, _opts) {},
    async getKeys(base, _opts) {},
    async clear(base, _opts) {},
    async dispose() {},
    async watch(callback) {},
  };
});

const storage = createStorage({
  driver: myStorageDriver(),
});
```

Some important notes:

- Keys should be normalized following `foo:bar` convention
- Remove any open watcher and handlers in `dispose()`
- Returning a promise is optional, you can return a direct value (see [memory driver](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage/blob/main/src/drivers/memory.ts))
- You don't have acces to the mount base
- Value returned by `getItem` can be a serializable `object` or `string`
- When setting `watch` method, unstorage default handler will be disabled. You are responsible to emit event on `getItem`, `setItem` and `removeItem`.
