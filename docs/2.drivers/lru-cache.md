# LRU Cache

> Keeps cached data in memory using LRU Cache.

## Usage

Keeps cached data in memory using [LRU Cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache).

See [`lru-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache) for supported options.

By default, [`max`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache#max) setting is set to `1000` items.

A default behavior for [`sizeCalculation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache#sizecalculation) option is implemented based on buffer size of both key and value.

```js
import { createStorage } from "unstorage";
import lruCacheDriver from "unstorage/drivers/lru-cache";

const storage = createStorage({
  driver: lruCacheDriver(),
});
```
