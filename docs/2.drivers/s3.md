# S3

> Store data to storage to S3-compatible providers.

S3 driver allows storing KV data to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or any other S3-compatible provider.

Driver implementation is lightweight and based on [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) working with Node.js as well as edge workers.

## Setup

Setup a "Bucket" in your S3-compatible provider. You need this info:

- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key
- Bucket name
- Endpoint
- Region

Make sure to install required peer dependencies:

:pm-install{name="aws4fetch"}

Then please make sure to set all driver's options:

```ts
import { createStorage } from "unstorage";
import s3Driver from "unstorage/drivers/s3";

const storage = createStorage({
  driver: s3Driver({
    accessKeyId: "", // Access Key ID
    secretAccessKey: "", // Secret Access Key
    endpoint: "",
    bucket: "",
    region: "",
  }),
});
```

**Options:**

- `bulkDelete`: (optional) Set to `true` to speedup `clear()` calls
  - **Note:** [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObjects.html) support is required from provider

## Tested providers

- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  - Set `endpoint` to `https://s3.[region].amazonaws.com/`
  - `bulkDelete` is supported
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/)
  - Set `endpoint` to `https://[uid].r2.cloudflarestorage.com/`
  - Set `region` to `auto`
  - `bulkDelete` is supported

Pull-Requests are more than welcome to add info about other tested providers!
