# Unstorage

A unified and powerful async Key-Value storage with conventional features like multi driver mounting, watching and working with metadata, dozens of built-in drivers and a [tiny core](https://bundlephobia.com/package/unstorage).

## Features

- Designed for all environments: Browser, NodeJS, and Workers
- Lots of Built-in drivers
- Asynchronous API
- Unix-style driver mounting to combine storages
- Default [in-memory](/drivers/memory) storage
- Tree-shakable utils and tiny core
- Auto JSON value serialization and deserialization
- Banary and raw value support
- State [snapshots](/utils#snapshots) and hydration
- Storage watcher
- HTTP Storage with [built-in server](/server)

## Why?

In web applications, we usually choose one or more storage backends based on our use-cases such as filesystem, a database or LocalStorage for browsers. It soon starts to be create troubles for supporting and combining more than one or switching between them. For JavaScript library authors, this usually means they have to decide how many platforms they support and implement storage for each.
