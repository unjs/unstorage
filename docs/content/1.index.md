# Unstorage

A unified and powerful Key-Value (KV) interface supporting built-in or custom [drivers](/drivers/custom) with conventional features like mounting, watching and working with metadata.

## Features


::list
- Work in all environments: Browser, NodeJS, and Workers
- Built-in drivers
- Asynchronous API
- Unix-style driver mounting to combine storages
- Default [in-memory](/drivers/memory) storage
- Tree-shakable utils and tiny core
- Native aware value `serialization` and `deserialization`
- Restore initial state (hydration)
- State [snapshots](/utils#snapshots)
- Driver agnostic watcher
- HTTP Storage [server](/server)
- [Namespaced storage](/utils)
- [Overlay driver](/drivers/overlay) (copy-on-write)
- Binary and raw operations support (experimental)

## Why?

We choose one or more data storage based on our use-cases: a filesystem, a database or LocalStorage for browsers.

It soon starts to be create troubles for supporting and combining more than one or switching between them. For JavaScript library authors, this usually means they have to decide how many platforms they support and implement storage for each.

Comparing to similar solutions like [localforage](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/), unstorage core is almost 6x smaller (`28.9kB` vs `4.7kB`). It uses modern ESM/Typescript/Async syntax and more features to be used universally.
