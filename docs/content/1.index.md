# Introduction

Unstorage provides an async Key-Value storage API with conventional features like multi driver mounting, watching and working with metadata, dozens of built-in drivers and a [tiny core](https://bundlephobia.com/package/unstorage).

## Why?

We usually choose one or more storage backends based on our use-cases such as filesystem, a database or LocalStorage for browsers. It soon starts to be create troubles for supporting and combining more than one or switching between them. For JavaScript library authors, this usually means they have to decide how many platforms they support and implement storage for each.
