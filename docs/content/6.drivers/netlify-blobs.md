# Netlify Blobs

Store data in a [Netlify Blobs](https://docs.netlify.com/blobs/overview/) store. This is supported in both edge and Node.js runtimes, as well at during builds.

::alert{type="warning"}
Netlify Blobs are in beta.
::

```js
import { createStorage } from "unstorage";
import netlifyBlobsDriver from "unstorage/drivers/netlify-blobs";

const storage = createStorage({
  driver: netlifyBlobsDriver({
    name: "blob-store-name",
  }),
});
```

You can create a deploy-scoped store by settings `deployScoped` option to `true`. This will mean that the deploy only has access to its own store. The store is managed alongside the deploy, with the same deploy previews, deletes, and rollbacks.

```js
import { createStorage } from "unstorage";
import netlifyBlobsDriver from "unstorage/drivers/netlify-blobs";

const storage = createStorage({
  driver: netlifyBlobsDriver({
    deployScoped: true,
  }),
});
```

To use, you will need to install `@netlify/blobs` as dependency or devDependency in your project:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@netlify/blobs": "*"
  }
}
```

**Options:**

- `name` - The name of the store to use. It is created if needed. This is required except for deploy-scoped stores.
- `deployScoped` - If set to `true`, the store is scoped to the deploy. This means that it is only available from that deploy, and will be deleted or rolled-back alongside it.
- `siteID` - Required during builds, where it is available as `constants.SITE_ID`. At runtime this is set automatically.
- `token` - Required during builds, where it is available as `constants.NETLIFY_API_TOKEN`. At runtime this is set automatically.

**Advanced options:**

These are not normally needed, but are available for advanced use cases or for use in unit tests.

- `apiURL`
- `edgeURL`
